        <h2>New Land Rover Discovery is out!</h2>
        <img src="./img/2019-Land-Rover-Discovery-silver.jpg" alt="Land Rover Discovery 2019" height="600px">
        <h3>Main changes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Land Rover's three-row Discovery SUV cruises into 2021 with new powertrains, updated infotainment,
                    and freshened styling.</h4>
                While styling tweaks for the 2021 Land Rover Defender are fairly subtle, the brand's three-row family
                SUV
                receives more meaningful updates under the hood and inside the cabin.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Gone are last year's diesel and supercharged V-6 engines; new engines include a turbo four and a
                    turbocharged inline-six with a 48-volt hybrid system.
                </h4>
                Last year's Discovery models were
                available with either a 254-hp turbo-diesel V-6 or a supercharged gasoline-powered 340-hp V-6 engine,
                but
                both have been tossed out in favor of a 296-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a turbocharged
                3.0-liter inline-six.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>The Discovery inherits the new Pivi Pro infotainment system from the Defender and also gains a new
                    midrange R-Dynamic trim level.</h4>
                Inside, the Disco receives Land Rover's new Pivi Pro infotainment system on a new 11.4-inch touchscreen
                display. Launched in the reimagined 2020 Defender, Pivi Pro boasts a more simplistic menu layout,
                quicker-responses, and over-the-air update capability.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Prices</h3>
        <p>The 2021 Discovery is expected in U.S. dealerships by the end of 2020 with a starting price of $55,250 for
            the base S model with the turbocharged four-cylinder engine. <br> Upgrading to the midrange R-Dynamic moves
            the
            starting price to $57,750; the R-Dynamic with the more powerful inline-six engine starts at $63,250, and the
            top-spec HSE, which comes standard with the six-cylinder, costs $70,250.</p>
